## Research Topic#2: Enhancing Network Slicing Security through Blockchain and IoT Integration

### Problem Statement
Network slicing, a transformative technology creating multiple virtual networks on a single physical network, faces challenges in centralized control and vulnerability. To address this, combining Blockchain and IoT offers the potential for a decentralized network-slicing platform. This shift can enhance security, reliability, and scalability by allowing distributed nodes to manage network slices.

### Research Questions
1. How can the integration of Blockchain and IoT facilitate the creation of a decentralized network-slicing platform?
2. What advantages does the utilization of Blockchain and IoT bring to the development of a secure network-slicing platform?
3. What hurdles are associated with adopting Blockchain and IoT for the establishment of a decentralized network slicing platform?

### Methodology
This study employs a dual approach, combining theoretical analysis and practical experimentation. Theoretical models encompassing Blockchain, IoT, and network slicing will be developed. These models will be translated into tangible implementations and rigorously tested using real-world data.

### Expected Results
The anticipated outcome of this research is a novel approach to creating a decentralized network-slicing platform using the synergistic power of Blockchain and IoT. This innovation is poised to significantly enhance the security, reliability, and scalability of network slicing operations, fortifying them against threats and unauthorized access.
