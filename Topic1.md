**Research Topic #1: Blockchain and AI-Driven Decentralized Healthcare Management**

**Problem Statement:**
Centralized healthcare systems face challenges in terms of data security, transparency, and continuity. Traditional cloud-based solutions encounter single-point failures, security breaches, and privacy issues. Remote patient monitoring and data sharing require a robust framework to address these concerns.

**Research Questions:**
1. How can decentralized healthcare frameworks utilizing blockchain and AI overcome the limitations of centralized healthcare systems?
2. What are the key components of the proposed framework that enhance data security, transparency, and patient healthcare record management?
3. How can AI-driven smart contracts and a public blockchain network be integrated to ensure trustworthy patient healthcare records?
4. What improvements can be achieved in terms of energy consumption, transaction speed, latency, and fees through experimental analysis of the proposed framework?

**Methodology:**
The research combines the potential of blockchain and AI to create a decentralized healthcare management framework. By leveraging AI-enabled smart contracts and a public blockchain network, the framework guarantees the integrity, security, and transparency of patient healthcare records. Malicious IoT nodes are identified using AI techniques. Real-time experimentation is conducted to analyze the enhancements achieved in terms of energy consumption, transaction throughput, latency, and fees.

**Expected Results:**
The research is expected to yield a decentralized healthcare framework that addresses the limitations of centralized systems. The proposed model will ensure secure and transparent patient healthcare records, reducing the risks of data breaches and single-point failures. The integration of AI will enhance the framework's ability to identify malicious nodes, bolstering system security. Experimental results are anticipated to showcase improvements in energy efficiency, transaction speed, latency, and transaction fees.
